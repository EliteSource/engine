- Animation Engine
- Collision Engine (Idea: Only check collision onEntityMove();)
- Tweak render engine (render distances)
- Add new events (onMove(), onCollide(), onEvent etc..)
- Add Location to Entity
- Rewrite model system, should include actually how to draw it instead of just textures.
- Fix collision engine
